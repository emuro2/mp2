1. I changed the top-bar to be a sticky nav bar that stays at the top of the page. I also changed to default colors of the top-bar, hover elements, and transparency. 

2. I included my smooth scrolling functionality from mp1 because the foundation top-bar does not include it by default. I also removed a lot of transparency I had in mp1 because according to the feedback from the peer reviews, it was too much. So I decided to make a landing page image and a title.

3. I used contrast and minimalistic design for the rest of the website. I made sure that there was enough background/text color contrast to make text more readable. Also, the different fonts and their sizes add for a nice styling on the page. The carousel is more simple now and has autoplay when the page is loaded.
